## What this is

An **optional frontend** that exposes the gateway core (`GatewayState` + `Bridge`)
over the State-Protocol `Envelope` wire format, transported on SSE. This is the
integration surface AIRP-State-Protocol's UI talks to when it is not running
inside the Tauri shell.

It lives in `src/agentbus/` and `examples/agentbus_sse.rs`. It does **not**
modify `bridge/mod.rs` or `server/mod.rs` — per ADR-007, the adapter is built
entirely on top of the already-public `GatewayState::build` / `Bridge::dispatch`
seam.

## HTTP surface

| Method | Path              | Body / Response                | Purpose                         |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| POST   | `/airp/dispatch`  | JSON `Envelope`                | Upstream: UI → gateway          |
| GET    | `/airp/stream`    | `text/event-stream`            | Downstream: gateway → UI (SSE)  |

Each SSE `data:` line is one JSON `Envelope`. The UI opens the SSE connection
once, holds it open, and receives every downstream envelope the gateway emits.
`subscribe` intents narrow which scopes a given connection receives.

### Connection correlation

The connection id is the join key between the (downstream) SSE stream and the
(upstream) `POST /airp/dispatch` calls. Two ways to set it:

- **Client-supplied** (recommended for browsers): open `GET /airp/stream?conn=<id>`
  with your own id (a browser `EventSource` cannot set request headers, only the
  URL). Echo the same id as the `x-airp-conn` header on every `POST /airp/dispatch`.
- **Server-assigned**: if you omit `?conn=`, the gateway generates one and sends
  it as the **first SSE event**, `event: airp-ready` with the id as its `data:`.
  Read that, then echo it via `x-airp-conn` on subsequent dispatches.

The adapter uses this id to attribute `subscribe` intents to the right SSE
stream; a connection that never subscribes receives all scopes. When the stream
drops (client disconnect or shutdown) the adapter clears that connection's scope
filter automatically.

(If you later switch to WebSocket, the connection id becomes implicit and both
the `?conn=` query and the `x-airp-conn` header go away.)

## Mapping rules (the only designed part)

| UI upstream                          | Gateway action                                                                | Downstream reply                                    |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `hello`                              | log client + accept list; emit initial blueprint / manifests / per-scope state | multiple `Envelope`s + an `ack`                    |
| `intent name=X params=P source=S`    | `Bridge::match_route("POST", "/v1/X")` → `dispatch` → MCP `call_tool`         | `state op:set` on scope `S` (or fallback)           |
| `subscribe scopes=[...]`             | set this connection's scope filter                                            | none (ack only)                                     |
| `ack ref=R`                          | log/metric                                                                    | none                                                |

### Decisions (locked)

1. **intent → RouteRule mapping: reuse existing `[[routes]]`.** The intent name
   is the route path minus the `/v1/` prefix. `chat.send` → `POST /v1/chat.send`.
   Zero new config. No match → downstream `error` envelope with `code: "no_route"`.

2. **MCP result → state envelope: `state op:set` the whole scope.** The adapter
   prefers `structuredContent` from the MCP tool result (per spec); falls back to
   the raw result. It emits a single `replace` patch at the scope root. Per-field
   patches are a later iteration — `set` is a valid patch and the UI reactive
   store handles it by replacing the scope.

3. **scope resolution order: `intent.source` → `fallback_scopes` table →
   `default_scope` → `error`.** The `source` field on the intent body (the widget
   instance id that emitted it) always wins. Without it, the adapter consults a
   per-intent fallback table, then a global default. If none resolve, the intent
   is rejected with a downstream `error` envelope (`code: "no_scope"`).

## Envelope wire contract

Truth lives in `AIRP-State-Protocol/schema/airp-state-protocol.schema.json`
(draft 2020-12). The adapter implements the subset needed for the minimal closed
loop and is forward-compatible: unknown `kind` values deserialize to a catch-all
`Unknown` variant (logged, dropped) rather than crashing the gateway.

Notable: the correlation field is `ref` on the wire (a Rust keyword); the Rust
struct field is `ref_` with `#[serde(rename = "ref")]`. Same for `Ack.ref` and
`Error.ref`. See `src/agentbus/envelope.rs` for the full type list.

## How the UI connects

On the AIRP-State-Protocol side, add an `SSEBus implements AgentBus`:

```typescript
// dispatch (upstream)
await fetch(`${gateway}/airp/dispatch`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "content-type": "application/json", "x-airp-conn": connId },
  body: JSON.stringify(envelope),
});

// subscribe (downstream)
const es = new EventSource(`${gateway}/airp/stream`);
es.onmessage = (e) => handler(JSON.parse(e.data));
```

`bus-factory.ts` picks `SSEBus` when not in the Tauri shell; `TauriBus` still
used inside the shell (Tauri IPC → Rust core → Gateway HTTP). The transport is
transparent to the UI — only the bus implementation changes.

## Running the example

The example binary mounts the adapter alongside the gateway's built-in HTTP
surface, with a stdio mock MCP upstream so it runs with no external project:

```sh
# 1. Build the mock MCP server (the stdio upstream).
cargo build --example mock_mcp_stdio

# 2. Run the adapter example.
AIRP_MCP_BIN=target/debug/examples/mock_mcp_stdio \
  cargo run --example agentbus_sse

# 3. The gateway logs its surface:
#    POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/airp/dispatch
#    GET  http://127.0.0.1:8080/airp/stream
#    upstream: stdio `mock_mcp_stdio` (tool `echo`)
```

Env knobs: `AIRP_BIND` (default `127.0.0.1:8080`), `AIRP_MCP_BIN` (the stdio
binary path), `AIRP_ACCESS_KEY` (optional bearer; unset = open).

The example wires one route: `POST /v1/chat.send` → MCP tool `echo`. The mock
echoes the call args back under `structuredContent`, so the closed loop is:

```
UI POST /airp/dispatch { intent chat.send, params {text:"hello"} }
  → adapter matches route /v1/chat.send
  → Bridge::dispatch → McpClient::call_tool("echo", {text:"hello"})
  → mock returns { structuredContent: { reply:"echo", received:{text:"hello"} } }
  → adapter emits state op:set on scope w-chat (from intent.source or fallback)
  → broadcast → SSE → UI receives → patch reactive store → ChatWidget re-renders
```

## Verification

- **Integration tests** (`tests/agentbus_adapter.rs`): the minimal closed loop
  against an in-process mock MCP transport (no subprocess). Five tests cover:
  intent → state patch roundtrip; unknown intent → error envelope; scope
  fallback table; `hello` emits initial blueprint/state; wrong envelope version
  rejected.
- **Cross-process e2e** (`tests/e2e_stdio.rs`, existing): the gateway core
  roundtrip via a real subprocess. The adapter sits on top of the same core, so
  this still validates the MCP dispatch path the adapter relies on.

## Limits / next iterations

- **Streaming tools** (`RouteTarget::Tool { stream: true }`): the adapter
  rejects these with a `stream_unsupported` error envelope. Streaming maps onto
  the gateway's own Stage 2 SSE work (DESIGN.md §Stage 2); when that lands, the
  adapter forwards partial results as incremental `state op:patch` envelopes.
- **`state op:patch` granularity**: today the adapter emits `op:set` (whole
  scope replace). Per-field JSON Patch needs per-tool patch templates, which
  belong in a later, domain-aware mapping config — not the current generic core.
- **blueprint/manifest authority**: the example wires a static initial
  blueprint. A real deployment would source it from a config file or a dedicated
  MCP resource read on `hello`.
